    This function is used to determine the mean variance of each column in
    a given matrix of standard deviations with n observations in each colum
%}

% obsSD a m x o matrix of SD's
% n a 1 x n vector of the number of non NaN values in each column
function [meanVar] = loopMeanVar(obsSD,n)
meanSD = obsSD ./ sqrt(n);
meanVar = meanSD.^2;
