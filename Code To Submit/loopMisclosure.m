    This function is used to determine the misclosure in a levelling loop
    and the associated standard deviation
%}

%means the average observation of each observation
%meanVar the variance of each mean observation
function [misclosure,misclosureSD] = loopMisclosure(means,meanVar)
%adds all of the observation means
misclosure = sum(means);
%adds all of the observation variances
misclosureVar = sum(meanVar);
misclosureSD = sqrt(misclosureVar);
